## Personal Statment

As you noticed this personal project tried to convey and give a feeling, as being a
person who used one of many computer systems existed almost three decades ago.
If someone was a curious kid during that period, they should know where I'm heading.
I didn't want to bring back everything in this project like it was age's ago and
replicate everything in very small details like Windows 98 used to be and to have
a same ugly low-resolution Graphical User Interface (GUI). Either, I am not a romantic
person, who still remembers the good old days spent with friends next to a computer
screen protected with a greenish cover from low refresh rate and playing DUNE from
a floppy disk. Ufff, that was very impressive. However, I still don't get it till now,
how they managed to fit all polyphonic soundtracks, graphical assets and code inside
one 2MB size floppy disk. I am still thinking it was made with Magic!
